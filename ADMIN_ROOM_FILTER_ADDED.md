# Room Filter Added to Admin Jobs

## Summary

Added a **Room Filter** to the Django admin jobs section, allowing you to filter jobs by specific rooms.

**Date**: October 8, 2025  
**File Modified**: `/home/sqreele/next_last/backend/myLubd/src/myappLubd/admin.py`

---

## Changes Made

### ‚úÖ 1. Created RoomFilter Class (Lines 357-367)

Added a new custom filter class that allows filtering jobs by room:

```python
class RoomFilter(admin.SimpleListFilter):
    title = 'room'
    parameter_name = 'room'

    def lookups(self, request, model_admin):
        return [(str(r.id), r.name) for r in Room.objects.all().order_by('name')]

    def queryset(self, request, queryset):
        if self.value():
            return queryset.filter(rooms__id=self.value()).distinct()
        return queryset
```

**Features**:
- Shows all rooms in alphabetical order
- Filters jobs by room ID
- Uses `.distinct()` to avoid duplicate results (since jobs can have multiple rooms)
- Follows the same pattern as the existing PropertyFilter

### ‚úÖ 2. Added RoomFilter to JobAdmin (Line 374)

Updated the `list_filter` configuration in JobAdmin:

**Before**:
```python
list_filter = ['status', 'priority', 'is_defective', 'created_at', 'updated_at', 'is_preventivemaintenance', 'user', PropertyFilter]
```

**After**:
```python
list_filter = ['status', 'priority', 'is_defective', 'created_at', 'updated_at', 'is_preventivemaintenance', 'user', PropertyFilter, RoomFilter]
```

## How to Use

1. **Access Django Admin**: Go to `http://localhost:8000/admin/`
2. **Navigate to Jobs**: Click on "Jobs" in the left sidebar
3. **Use the Room Filter**: Look at the right sidebar, you'll now see a **"Room"** filter
4. **Select a Room**: Click on any room name to filter jobs by that specific room
5. **Clear Filter**: Click "All" to show all jobs again

---

## Filter Behavior

- **Single Selection**: You can select one room at a time
- **Distinct Results**: Jobs with multiple rooms won't appear duplicated
- **Alphabetical Order**: Rooms are listed alphabetically for easy finding
- **Combines with Other Filters**: Works alongside status, priority, property, and other filters

## Available Filters in Jobs Admin

Now the Jobs admin has these filters in the right sidebar:

1. ‚úÖ **Status** - Filter by job status (pending, in_progress, completed, etc.)
2. ‚úÖ **Priority** - Filter by priority (low, medium, high)
3. ‚úÖ **Is defective** - Filter by defective flag
4. ‚úÖ **Created at** - Filter by creation date
5. ‚úÖ **Updated at** - Filter by update date
6. ‚úÖ **Is preventivemaintenance** - Filter by PM flag
7. ‚úÖ **User** - Filter by assigned user
8. ‚úÖ **Property** - Filter by property (existing)
9. ‚úÖ **Room** - Filter by room (NEW! ‚≠ê)

---

## Technical Details

**Implementation Pattern**: 
- Uses Django's `SimpleListFilter` class
- Queries the Room model for all available rooms
- Filters jobs through the ManyToMany relationship (`rooms`)
- Uses `.distinct()` to handle jobs with multiple rooms

**Database Query**:
```python
queryset.filter(rooms__id=self.value()).distinct()
```

This filters jobs that have the selected room in their `rooms` ManyToMany relationship.

## Status

- ‚úÖ Container restarted successfully
- ‚úÖ Server running on port 8000
- ‚úÖ Ready to use
