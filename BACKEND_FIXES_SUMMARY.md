# Backend Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **Invalid HTTP_HOST header**: Django was rejecting requests with HTTP_HOST header 'backend:8000'
2. **JWT decode warning**: Error message "decode() missing 1 required positional argument: 'key'"

## Fixes Applied

### 1. ALLOWED_HOSTS Configuration (settings.py)

- Updated `ALLOWED_HOSTS` to include hosts with port numbers (e.g., 'backend:8000', 'django-backend:8000')
- Added logic to automatically append essential hosts with common ports
- Added logging to help debug ALLOWED_HOSTS configuration
- Enhanced environment variable parsing to be more robust

### 2. JWT Authentication Error Handling (auth.py)

- Improved error handling in the JWT decoding section
- Split generic Exception catching into specific JWTError and generic Exception
- Added more descriptive error messages to help identify the actual issue
- The warning was caused by error handling code trying to show exception details

### 3. Debug Tools Added

- Created `check_settings.py` script to debug Django settings
- Created `middleware.py` with DebugHostMiddleware for logging HTTP_HOST issues
- Added HealthCheckMiddleware to handle health check requests

## How to Verify the Fixes

1. Restart the backend service:
   ```bash
   docker-compose restart backend
   ```

2. Check the logs to confirm no more ALLOWED_HOSTS errors:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs -f backend
   ```

3. The fixes should resolve:
   - "Invalid HTTP_HOST header: 'backend:8000'" errors
   - "Could not decode unverified payload" warnings

## Additional Notes

- The JWT warning was not critical - it was just error handling trying to log exception details
- The ALLOWED_HOSTS issue was due to internal Docker networking using 'backend:8000' with port
- Health check endpoints should now work properly from any host
