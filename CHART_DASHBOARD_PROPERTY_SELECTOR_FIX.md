# Chart Dashboard Property Selector Fix

## Issue
The chart dashboard at `/dashboard/chartdashboard/` was missing a property selector UI. Users could not select which property to view charts for, making the dashboard non-functional for property-specific data viewing.

## Root Cause
The `PropertyJobsDashboard` component was correctly reading the `selectedPropertyId` from the global store and filtering jobs accordingly, but the chart dashboard page (`page.tsx`) did not include any UI component to allow users to actually **select** a property. The property had to be selected from other pages (like profile or other dashboards) which was not intuitive.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Property Selector to Chart Dashboard Page
**File: `frontend/Lastnext/app/dashboard/chartdashboard/page.tsx`**

- Imported the existing `HeaderPropertyList` component that provides a property dropdown selector
- Added the component to both the main view and the error fallback view
- Updated the header layout to accommodate the property selector with responsive design

**Changes:**
```typescript
// Added import
import HeaderPropertyList from '@/app/components/jobs/HeaderPropertyList';

// Updated header UI (both in main return and error fallback)
<div className="flex flex-col sm:flex-row items-start sm:items-center justify-between gap-3">
  <h1 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">Analytics</h1>
  <HeaderPropertyList />
</div>
```

### 2. Fixed Memoization Dependencies
**File: `frontend/Lastnext/app/components/jobs/PropertyJobsDashboard.tsx`**

- Fixed the `jobStats` useMemo hook to include `backendStats` in dependencies
- This ensures the charts update correctly when backend statistics change after property selection

**Changes:**
```typescript
// Before
const jobStats = useMemo(() => {
  // ... calculation using backendStats
}, [filteredJobs]);

// After
const jobStats = useMemo(() => {
  // ... calculation using backendStats
}, [filteredJobs, backendStats]);
```

## How It Works Now

1. **Property Selection**: Users can now click the property dropdown in the chart dashboard header to select which property they want to view analytics for

2. **Automatic Updates**: When a property is selected:
   - The selection is stored in the global state (Zustand store)
   - `PropertyJobsDashboard` component detects the change via `selectedPropertyId`
   - Jobs are filtered based on the selected property
   - Backend stats are refetched for the new property
   - All charts update automatically:
     - Jobs by Status (pie chart)
     - Jobs by Month (bar chart)
     - Jobs per User (bar chart and table)
     - Summary Statistics

3. **Responsive Design**: The property selector adapts to mobile and desktop screens with proper spacing and layout

## Files Modified

1. `frontend/Lastnext/app/dashboard/chartdashboard/page.tsx`
   - Added HeaderPropertyList import
   - Added property selector to header (2 locations: main and error fallback)
   - Updated header flex layout for responsive design

2. `frontend/Lastnext/app/components/jobs/PropertyJobsDashboard.tsx`
   - Fixed jobStats memoization dependencies

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Property Selection**: 
   - Navigate to `/dashboard/chartdashboard`
   - Click the property dropdown
   - Select different properties
   - Verify all charts update correctly

2. **Multi-Property Users**:
   - Test with users who have access to multiple properties
   - Ensure switching between properties updates all charts

3. **Single Property Users**:
   - Test with users who have access to only one property
   - Verify the dropdown still appears and shows the single property

4. **No Properties**:
   - Test with users who have no properties assigned
   - Verify appropriate messaging is displayed
