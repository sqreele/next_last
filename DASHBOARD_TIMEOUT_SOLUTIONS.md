# Dashboard Timeout Error Solutions

## Problem Summary
The dashboard at https://pcms.live/dashboard/ is experiencing timeout errors due to:
1. Short frontend API timeout (10 seconds)
2. Multiple sequential API calls on dashboard load
3. Potential backend performance issues

## Immediate Solutions

### 1. Increase Frontend API Timeout
Edit `/frontend/Lastnext/app/lib/api/jobsApi.ts`:

```javascript
// Change line 190 from:
const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 10000); // 10 second timeout

// To:
const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 30000); // 30 second timeout
```

### 2. Add Loading State Management
The dashboard already has loading states, but ensure they're working properly to give users feedback during long loads.

### 3. Implement Pagination
Modify the jobs API call to fetch data in smaller chunks:

```javascript
// In useJobsDashboard.ts, modify the getJobs call:
const jobs = await jobsApi.getJobs(accessToken, {
  ...state.filters,
  limit: 50,  // Start with first 50 jobs
  offset: 0
});
```

## Long-term Solutions

### 1. Backend Performance Optimization
- Add database indexes on frequently queried fields (job status, created_at, property_id)
- Implement query optimization for the jobs endpoint
- Add Redis caching for frequently accessed data

### 2. Frontend Optimization
- Implement progressive loading (load essential data first)
- Use React Query or SWR for better caching
- Add request debouncing to prevent duplicate calls

### 3. API Response Optimization
- Implement GraphQL or selective field fetching
- Add server-side pagination
- Compress API responses

### 4. Infrastructure Improvements
- Use a CDN for static assets
- Implement database connection pooling
- Consider horizontal scaling for the backend

## Quick Fix Implementation

To immediately resolve the timeout issue, apply this patch:

```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd /workspace/frontend/Lastnext

# Edit the jobsApi.ts file to increase timeout
# Change line 190 to use 30000ms instead of 10000ms
```

## Monitoring Recommendations

1. Add API response time logging
2. Implement error tracking (Sentry, LogRocket)
3. Set up performance monitoring for database queries
4. Create alerts for slow API endpoints

## Testing the Fix

After implementing changes:
1. Clear browser cache
2. Test dashboard load time
3. Monitor network tab for API response times
4. Check server logs for any errors

## Additional Considerations

- The real-time updates feature is currently disabled, which is good for performance
- Consider lazy loading dashboard sections
- Implement a service worker for offline capability
