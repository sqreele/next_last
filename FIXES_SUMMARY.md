# Preventive Maintenance Form Fixes

## Issues Identified

1. **Property ID as Array**: The backend was returning `property_id` as an array instead of a single string value
2. **Date Validation**: Completed date was allowed to be before scheduled date, violating business rules
3. **Missing Frontend Validation**: No validation to ensure dates are logical before submission
4. **Type Mismatch**: Frontend type definition allowed property_id to be either string or array

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Frontend Form Validation (PreventiveMaintenanceForm.tsx)
- Added date validation to ensure completed_date is not before scheduled_date
- Added validation to ensure property_id is set when machines are selected
- Added proper error handling and user feedback

### 2. Backend Serializer Updates (serializers.py)
- Modified `get_property_id` method in all PreventiveMaintenance serializers to return a single string instead of an array
- Since all machines must belong to the same property (per validation), we now return the property_id of the first machine

### 3. Type Definition Update (preventiveMaintenanceModels.ts)
- Changed `property_id` type from `string | string[] | null` to `string | null`
- This ensures type consistency throughout the application

## Testing

Both frontend and backend servers have been started. You can now test the form submission with proper data validation.

## Expected Behavior

1. Form will reject submission if completed_date is before scheduled_date
2. Form will require property selection when machines are selected
3. Backend will return property_id as a single string value
4. All validation errors will be displayed to the user before submission
