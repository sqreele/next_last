# PDF Export - Single Image Display

## Overview

When exporting jobs to PDF from the `/dashboard/` route, the system displays **only ONE image per job**, not all images associated with that job.

## Behavior

### Current Implementation

- ✅ **One Image Per Job**: The PDF export shows only the first supported image for each job
- ✅ **Smart Selection**: The system automatically selects the best available image based on priority
- ✅ **Supported Formats**: Only JPG, JPEG, PNG, and GIF images are included in PDFs
- ✅ **Consistent Layout**: Single image display ensures consistent PDF layout and manageable file sizes

### Image Selection Priority

When a job has multiple images, the system selects them in this priority order:

1. **First JPEG URL** (`job.images[0].jpeg_url`) - Preferred for best compatibility
2. **First Image URL** (`job.images[0].image_url` or `job.images[0].url`)
3. **First URL from image_urls array** (`job.image_urls[0]`)

The first supported image found is used, and all other images are ignored for PDF export.

## Technical Details

### Key Files

1. **`/frontend/Lastnext/app/lib/utils/pdfImageUtils.ts`**
   - Function: `getSupportedImageFromJob(job)`
   - Returns: A single image URL (or null if none found)
   - Purpose: Core logic for selecting one image per job

2. **`/frontend/Lastnext/app/components/document/JobsPDFGenerator.tsx`**
   - Uses: `pickSupportedImageUrlFromJob()` which calls `getSupportedImageFromJob()`
   - Renders: Single `<Image>` component per job

3. **`/frontend/Lastnext/app/components/document/JobPDFTemplate.tsx`**
   - Uses: `getSupportedImageFromJob()` directly
   - Renders: Single `<Image>` component per job

### Code Example

```typescript
/**
 * Gets a single supported image from a job for PDF export.
 * 
 * ⚠️ IMPORTANT: This function returns ONLY ONE IMAGE (the first supported image found).
 * When exporting jobs to PDF, only one image per job will be displayed, not all images.
 */
export function getSupportedImageFromJob(job: any): string | null {
  // Collect all candidate images
  const candidates: string[] = [];
  
  // ... collect from job.images and job.image_urls ...
  
  // Return ONLY the FIRST supported image
  for (let rawUrl of candidates) {
    const resolvedUrl = getProductionImageUrl(rawUrl);
    const extension = getImageExtension(resolvedUrl);
    
    if (['jpg', 'jpeg', 'png', 'gif'].includes(extension)) {
      return resolvedUrl; // ← Returns immediately with first match
    }
  }
  
  return null;
}
```

## Benefits

### Why Only One Image?

1. **File Size Management**
   - PDFs with multiple images per job become very large
   - Single image keeps PDF size reasonable for download/email

2. **Consistent Layout**
   - Single image ensures predictable page layout
   - Prevents pagination issues and page breaks

3. **Professional Appearance**
   - Clean, organized reports with uniform structure
   - Easy to scan and review multiple jobs quickly

4. **Performance**
   - Faster PDF generation
   - Reduced memory usage during export
   - Quicker download times

## User Experience

### What Users See

When generating a PDF report:
- Each job entry displays **one representative image**
- If a job has no images, it shows a "No Image" placeholder
- All other job details (description, status, priority, etc.) are included

### Configuration Options

Through the PDF configuration dialog, users can:
- ✅ Toggle images on/off (`includeImages` option)
- ❌ Cannot select which image to show (always uses first available)
- ❌ Cannot show all images (by design)

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

If needed in the future, these features could be added:

1. **Image Selection**
   - Allow users to choose which image to display (first, last, specific index)
   - Add UI to select "featured" image for PDF export

2. **Multiple Image Modes**
   - Add "compact" mode (1 image, current)
   - Add "detailed" mode (all images, optional)
   - Add "thumbnail grid" mode (multiple small images)

3. **Image Preferences**
   - Remember user preference for image selection
   - Property-level settings for default image behavior

## Testing

To verify this behavior:

1. Navigate to `/dashboard/`
2. Select a property with jobs that have multiple images
3. Export jobs to PDF
4. Open the generated PDF
5. Verify: Each job shows only one image

## Summary

✅ **CONFIRMED**: PDF export from `/dashboard/` displays only ONE image per job, not all images. This is intentional and ensures optimal PDF performance, file size, and layout consistency.
