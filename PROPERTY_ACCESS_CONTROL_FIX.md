# Property Access Control Security Fixes

## Summary
Fixed critical security vulnerabilities where users could access data from properties they were not assigned to. This document outlines all the security improvements made to ensure proper property-based access control throughout the application.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **TopicViewSet - Missing Access Control** ✅ FIXED
**Issue:** Any authenticated user could view all topics in the system, regardless of property access.

**Fix:** Added property-based filtering to `get_queryset()`:
- Admin/staff users can see all topics
- Regular users can only see topics used in jobs/preventive maintenance within their accessible properties
- Returns distinct topics to avoid duplicates

**Location:** `backend/myLubd/src/myappLubd/views.py` - TopicViewSet class

---

### 2. **RoomViewSet - Debug Fallback Security Issue** ✅ FIXED
**Issue:** When a user had no accessible rooms, the system would return ALL rooms as a "debug fallback" (lines 880-898).

**Fix:** Removed debug fallback logic:
- Users now only see rooms from properties they have access to
- If no rooms are found, an empty queryset is returned (proper behavior)
- Prevents information disclosure about rooms in other properties

**Location:** `backend/myLubd/src/myappLubd/views.py` - RoomViewSet.get_queryset()

---

### 3. **RoomViewSet - Property Existence Disclosure** ✅ FIXED
**Issue:** When a user tried to access a property they didn't have access to, the system would fall back to showing their own rooms, potentially confirming the existence of the requested property.

**Fix:** Changed error handling:
- Now returns `Room.objects.none()` when user doesn't have access to requested property
- Prevents information leakage about property existence
- Provides consistent behavior for unauthorized access attempts

**Location:** `backend/myLubd/src/myappLubd/views.py` - RoomViewSet.get_queryset() exception handler

---

### 4. **RoomViewSet - Empty Room Fallback** ✅ FIXED
**Issue:** When no rooms were found for a valid property, system would fall back to showing all user's rooms (lines 831-836).

**Fix:** Removed fallback logic:
- Now returns the actual queryset even if empty
- Prevents confusion about which property's rooms are being displayed
- Maintains data integrity and user expectations

**Location:** `backend/myLubd/src/myappLubd/views.py` - RoomViewSet.get_queryset()

---

### 5. **UserProfileViewSet - Unauthorized Data Access** ✅ FIXED
**Issue:** The `detailed` action returned ALL user profiles for ANY authenticated user (line 1145-1146).

**Fix:** Added admin-only access control:
- `get_queryset()` now checks if user is admin/staff for 'detailed' action
- Non-admin users only see their own profile
- Added explicit permission check in `detailed()` action method
- Raises `PermissionDenied` exception for unauthorized access attempts

**Location:** `backend/myLubd/src/myappLubd/views.py` - UserProfileViewSet class

---

### 6. **MaintenanceProcedureViewSet - Write Access Control** ✅ FIXED
**Issue:** Any authenticated user could create, update, or delete maintenance procedures (which are shared templates).

**Fix:** Added admin-only write protection:
- `perform_create()`: Only admin users can create procedures
- `perform_update()`: Only admin users can update procedures
- `perform_destroy()`: Only admin users can delete procedures
- All users can view procedures (they are shared templates)
- Raises `PermissionDenied` for unauthorized modification attempts

**Location:** `backend/myLubd/src/myappLubd/views.py` - MaintenanceProcedureViewSet class

---

## Already Properly Protected (No Changes Needed)

### 1. **JobViewSet** ✅ Already Secure
- Filters jobs by user's accessible properties (lines 934-937)
- Admin/staff users can see all jobs
- Regular users only see jobs in their properties

### 2. **PropertyViewSet** ✅ Already Secure
- `get_queryset()` returns only user's accessible properties (lines 1192-1214)
- `get_object()` raises `PermissionDenied` for unauthorized access (line 1241)
- Admin/staff users can access all properties

### 3. **PreventiveMaintenanceViewSet** ✅ Already Secure
- Filters preventive maintenance by accessible properties (lines 100-109)
- Uses Q objects to check both job-based and machine-based property relationships
- Admin/staff users can see all PM tasks

### 4. **MachineViewSet** ✅ Already Secure
- Filters machines by property users (line 442)
- Admin/staff users can see all machines
- Regular users only see machines in their properties

---

## Security Model Summary

### User Property Access
Users are assigned to properties through the many-to-many relationship:
```python
Property.users = models.ManyToManyField(User, related_name='accessible_properties')
```

### Access Control Hierarchy
1. **Superuser/Staff**: Full access to all data
2. **Regular Users**: Access only to data within their assigned properties
3. **No Property Assignment**: No access to property-specific data

### Data Filtering Pattern
For all property-related data, the pattern is:
```python
if not (user.is_staff or user.is_superuser):
    accessible_property_ids = Property.objects.filter(users=user).values_list('id', flat=True)
    queryset = queryset.filter(<relationship>__in=accessible_property_ids)
```

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Checklist
1. **Test as non-admin user with property access:**
   - ✅ Can view topics used in their properties' jobs
   - ✅ Can view rooms in their assigned properties
   - ✅ Cannot view rooms in other properties
   - ✅ Cannot access other users' profiles via 'detailed' endpoint
   - ✅ Can view maintenance procedures but cannot create/edit/delete

2. **Test as non-admin user without property access:**
   - ✅ Sees empty results for topics, rooms, jobs
   - ✅ Cannot access any property data

3. **Test as admin/staff user:**
   - ✅ Can view all topics, rooms, jobs, properties
   - ✅ Can access all user profiles
   - ✅ Can create/edit/delete maintenance procedures

### Automated Testing
Consider adding integration tests to verify:
- Property-based filtering works correctly
- PermissionDenied exceptions are raised appropriately
- Admin bypass works for all ViewSets
- Empty querysets are returned (not exceptions) when user has no access

## Impact Assessment

### Security
- **High Impact**: Prevents unauthorized data access across properties
- Eliminates information disclosure vulnerabilities
- Enforces principle of least privilege

### User Experience
- **Minimal Impact**: Users will only see data they should have access to
- Removes confusion from debug fallbacks
- Provides consistent behavior

### Performance
- **Neutral/Positive**: Removed extra debug queries
- More efficient queries with proper filtering
- Distinct() calls prevent duplicate results

## Deployment Notes

### Pre-Deployment
1. Review all user-property assignments in the database
2. Ensure admin users are marked as `is_staff=True` or `is_superuser=True`
3. Verify that all users have appropriate property assignments

### Post-Deployment
1. Monitor logs for `PermissionDenied` exceptions
2. Verify users can access their assigned properties
3. Test admin functionality
4. Check for any unexpected access issues

### Rollback Plan
If issues arise, revert the changes to `views.py` from this commit.
