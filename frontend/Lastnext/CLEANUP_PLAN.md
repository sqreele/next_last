- `app/lib/user-context.tsx` - Used in 10+ components  
- `app/lib/JobContext.tsx` - Used in 3+ components

- `app/lib/TopicService.ts` - Used by PreventiveContext

## 🔄 **Migration Strategy**

### Phase 1: ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Removed all unused files (safe deletions)

### Phase 2: Migrate Components to Zustand
1. ✅ Update `app/layout.tsx` to use StoreProvider
2. ✅ Migrate components one by one:
   - ✅ Start with simple components
   - ✅ Update imports from old contexts to new store
   - ✅ Test functionality after each migration

#### ✅ **COMPLETED MIGRATIONS:**
- ✅ `app/layout.tsx` - Updated to use StoreProvider
- ✅ `app/dashboard/profile/ProfileDisplay.tsx` - Migrated from user-context + PropertyContext
- ✅ `app/components/jobs/JobCard.tsx` - Migrated from PropertyContext
- ✅ `app/components/jobs/HeaderPropertyList.tsx` - Migrated from PropertyContext
- ✅ `app/dashboard/myJobs/myJobs.tsx` - Migrated from user-context + JobContext
- ✅ `app/components/jobs/CreateJobForm.tsx` - Migrated from user-context + JobContext
- ✅ `app/components/preventive/PreventiveMaintenanceDashboard.tsx` - Migrated from PreventiveContext
- ✅ `app/dashboard/preventive-maintenance/pdf/page.tsx` - Migrated from FilterContext
- ✅ `app/dashboard/profile/edit/[id]/page.tsx` - Migrated from user-context + PropertyContext
- ✅ `app/dashboard/JobsContent.tsx` - Migrated from PropertyContext
- ✅ `app/components/jobs/RoomAutocomplete.tsx` - Migrated from PropertyContext
- ✅ `app/components/jobs/jobList.tsx` - Migrated from PropertyContext
- ✅ `app/dashboard/search/SearchContent.tsx` - Migrated from PropertyContext

### Phase 3: Remove Old Contexts
1. Delete `PropertyContext.tsx`
2. Delete `user-context.tsx`
3. Delete `JobContext.tsx`
4. Delete `PreventiveContext.tsx`
5. Delete `FilterContext.tsx`
6. Delete `MachineService.ts` (if no longer needed)
7. Delete `TopicService.ts` (if no longer needed)

## 📊 **Updated Usage Statistics**

| File | Import Count | Status |
|------|--------------|---------|
| `PropertyContext.tsx` | 15+ | 🔴 Needs Migration |
| `user-context.tsx` | 10+ | 🔴 Needs Migration |
| `JobContext.tsx` | 3+ | 🔴 Needs Migration |
| `PreventiveContext.tsx` | 8+ | 🔴 Needs Migration |
| `FilterContext.tsx` | 2+ | 🔴 Needs Migration |
| `MachineService.ts` | 2+ | 🔴 Needs Migration |
| `TopicService.ts` | 2+ | 🔴 Needs Migration |

## 🎯 **What's Been Accomplished**

### ✅ **Files Successfully Removed: 15 files**
- **Utility files**: 6 files removed
- **Data files**: 1 file removed  
- **Example files**: 2 files removed
- **Hook files**: 4 files removed
