# Jobs Report Feature

## Overview

The Jobs Report feature automatically generates comprehensive reports for jobs based on the user's selected property from their profile. This feature eliminates the need for manual property selection and ensures users only see data relevant to their assigned properties.

## Key Features

### ðŸ”„ Automatic Property Selection
- **User Profile Integration**: Automatically detects properties assigned to the user from their profile
- **Session Persistence**: Remembers the user's property selection across sessions
- **Smart Fallbacks**: Falls back to first available property if none is selected

### ðŸ“Š Comprehensive Reporting
- **Real-time Statistics**: Live calculation of job counts, completion rates, and response times
- **Visual Breakdowns**: Status distribution, priority analysis, and monthly trends
- **Property-specific Data**: All data is automatically filtered by the selected property

### ðŸ“„ PDF Generation
- **Professional Reports**: Generate detailed PDF reports with proper formatting
- **Image Support**: Includes job images when available
- **Customizable Content**: Configurable report options (statistics, images, details)

## How It Works

### 1. Property Detection
The system automatically detects the user's assigned properties from:
- User profile data
- Session information
- Property context

### 2. Smart Filtering
Jobs are filtered using multiple property association methods:
- Direct `property_id` match
- `properties` array association
- `profile_image.properties` association
- `rooms.properties` association

### 3. Report Generation
- Statistics are calculated in real-time
- PDF reports are generated with property-specific data
- Reports include comprehensive job information and visual elements

## Usage

### Accessing the Jobs Report
1. Navigate to **Dashboard** â†’ **Jobs Report**
2. The system automatically selects your assigned property
3. View comprehensive statistics and job breakdowns
4. Click **Download PDF** to generate a detailed report

### Property Selection
- **Automatic**: The system automatically selects your primary property
- **Manual Override**: Use the property selector in the header to change properties
- **Persistence**: Your selection is saved and restored across sessions

## Components

### JobsReport Component

## Technical Implementation

### Property Context Integration
```typescript
const { selectedProperty, userProperties } = useProperty();
const { userProfile } = useUser();
```

### Job Filtering Logic
```typescript
const filteredJobs = jobs.filter((job) => {
  if (!selectedProperty) return true;
  
  // Multiple property association checks
  if (job.property_id === selectedProperty) return true;
  if (job.properties?.some(prop => String(prop) === String(selectedProperty))) return true;
  // ... additional checks
});
```

### Statistics Calculation
```typescript
const statistics = useMemo(() => {
  const total = filteredJobs.length;
  const completed = filteredJobs.filter(job => job.status === 'completed').length;
  const completionRate = total > 0 ? Math.round((completed / total) * 100) : 0;
  // ... additional calculations
}, [filteredJobs]);
```
